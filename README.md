A web app that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they already have in their fridge and pantry in an effort to prevent food waste. 
Users can utilize a mobile friendly grocery list feature which allows them to add, strike out, and delete items. 
Future development will allow users to add their list to a shopping cart via walmart or amazon and have fresh produce delivered straight to their door.

Constructed using JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Express, and Node.
